Getting started with robotic sailing
====================================

This is an overview of the steps you need to think about to build a small
autonomous sailing boat, such as you might need to compete in WRSC.
We've tried to provide pointers both for how to get something basic to work,
and other approaches you might consider. Depending on the time, knowledge and
resources you have available, you can pick which areas to innovate in, and where
to get something basic working.

There are three main domains you'll need to think about:
the boat, the electronics, and the control software.
